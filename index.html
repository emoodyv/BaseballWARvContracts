    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>There are many different metrics to measure how good or valuable a baseball player is throughout a season. One metric is Wins Above Replacement or WAR. WAR is an attempt by the sabermetric baseball community to summarize a player’s total contributions to their team in one statistic. You should always use more than one metric at a time when evaluating players, but WAR is all-inclusive and provides a useful reference point for comparing players.
        WAR offers an estimate to answer the question, “If this player got injured and their team had to replace them with a freely available minor leaguer or a AAAA player from their bench, how much value would the team be losing?”
        This value is expressed in a wins format, so we could say that Player X is worth +6.3 wins to their team while Player Y is only worth +3.5 wins, which means it is highly likely that Player X has been more valuable than Player Y.

        Our hypothesis is that for players as their contract is nearing its ending term the player's WAR value will increase.

<!-- Section 2 -->
<section class="section section-dark" id="nav2">
    <p>
        In our original final dataset there were 11 variables:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>AGE</li>
        <li>Year</li>
        <li>Team</li>
        <li>League</li>
        <li>Player Salary</li>
        <li>Percent Season Played</li>
        <li>WAR_PSP</li>
        <li>Number of Injury Trips</li>
        <li>Team Win Percentage</li>
        <li>Team Payroll</li>
        <li>Percent Contract Completed</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Our target variable is WAR_PSP which hold each player's WAR value per season. Through the encoding process we discovered that the Team variable was not significant and could be dropped.
        Next we took the league variable and encoded the values into 0, 1, and 2 representing the American League (AL), National League (NL), and 2 for if a player was traded from AL to NL or vice-versa.
        Initially we chose to go with a linear regression model but we discovered during the training process that there were some colinearity issues with some of the variables that the model was unable to see as well as some variable that were unneccessary
    </p>
        <img src="img/charts/Linear regression p values.png" alt="OLS Results" class="charts">
    <p>
        After running the model we found that league and team payroll have the highest p-values meaning they are the least statistically significant variables. Therefore we dropped those columns in the dataset.
        Reflecting on our dataset and wondering why the accuracy scores were so low we discovered that there some variables that were collinear even though the model was saying that there were no issues.
        The "Percent_Season_Played" variable is actually already included in the "WAR_PSP" calculation making it a redundant variable.
        We then realized that our hypothesis was that a player's WAR would increase as they neared the end of their contract meaning that their WAR tracked over the length of their contract wouldn't be linear so using the OLS model wouldn't fit.

    </p>
    <p>
        We then switched from OLS to trying out Ridge and Lasso techniques. These also resulted in a low accuracy score. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Since our hypothesis was that a player's WAR wouldn't follow a linear pattern we had to try a different approach using the random RandomForestRegressor.
        Just by tweaking the type of model we were using we were able to achieve an accuracy of 98.3% with an R^2

    <p>
    Our chosen method to split the data was to make 80% of the data as training and 20% of the data as testing with a random state = 42.
    </p>
    <p>
    Running the RandomForestRegressor model on the training set we get an R^2 value of about 86% and an accuracy score of about 99%,
    confirming our decision to use this model in our analysis. When comparing the actual values and predicted values there is a very
    strong linear relationship diesplayed.

    <h3>Visualizing Important Features</h3>
      <p>
      Finding the important features also helped to verify that we chose the correct model, as none of the importance levels of our data columns were extremely low.
      </p>
        <img src="img/charts/FeatImpScores.png" alt="important scores" class="charts">

      <p>
      The accuracy score of our data means that it will predict the WAR score accurately for the X data set 95% of the time, the training set 99% of the time,
      and the testing set 92% of the time. These models are proven to be extremely accurate in prediction based on their high accuracy scores.
